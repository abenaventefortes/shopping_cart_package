# ShoppingCart GUI Guide

The ShoppingCart GUI provides a graphical interface to manage the shopping cart.

## Launching the GUI:

To start the GUI, simply run the shopping cart package from the command line:

`shopping_cart`

### Interface Components:

    Title:
    At the top, there's a label displaying "Shopping Cart".

    Items Table:
    Below the title, there's a table displaying all the items in the cart. The table has two columns: "Item" and "Price".

    Add Items:
        At the bottom, there are two input fields: one for the item name and another for its price.
        Next to the input fields, there's an "Add" button.
        To add an item:
            Enter the item name in the first input field.
            Enter the item's price in the second input field.
            Click the "Add" button. The item will be added to the cart and will appear in the items table above.

    Error Handling:
    If an invalid price (non-numeric value) is entered, an error message will pop up, informing the user to enter a valid number for the price.

## Exiting the GUI:

Close the GUI window to exit the application.
